- What Web Application security mechanisms are involved in your topology? What security mechanisms would ideally be involved?

    *Currently our web application is implementing a FLASK authetnication framework, allowing users with valid credientals to login. Also, we plan on integrating a docker headless zedd attack proxy to help us better understand what parts of our web related services are vulnerable.*
    
- What testing framework did you choose and why?

    *For our testing framework we chose to implement the selenium test automation framework since a group member had past experinces doing QA work with it. We chose selenium because it is extremely simple and stable to perform simple automated web tests in python. Overall, selenium may be somewhat outdated in terms of testing frameworks today,but it provides good and reliable information.*
